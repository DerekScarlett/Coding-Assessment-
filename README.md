# City Bikes API
Description:
.... will be using the React framework to build out a next generation web application. We
would like you to demonstrate your ability to learn the framework and create quality code.
The CityBikes API (https://api.citybik.es/v2/) provides a free RESTful API to retrieve bike-sharing data
from around the world. Using this API, retrieve station information from a network of your choice (or you
may use hubway) and display the name, number of free bikes, and number of empty slots for each
station.
Through your code you should demonstrate:
● Usage of a stateless functional component
● Usage of a class component
● Usage of props
● Usage of local state

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, react, rest api

Used a simple create-react-app command to create the initial framework then used axios to retreive the api response. Then I used that response to and assign values to props to then be displayed on the dom.

Lesson Learned.
Leanred about stateless functional compoments and how they interact with class components. If I have time to go back and work on this then I would add a new component and add a title to the project and take the network I used and displayed it at the top.
